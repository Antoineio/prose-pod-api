    summary: Initialize the the first XMPP account
    description: Initializes the first XMPP account on the server. It will be given
      the `ADMIN` role and this user will have to log in before making
      subsequent requests (like inviting other users). After one account is
      created, this unauthenticated route will always return `409 Conflict` to
      prevent unauthenticated users from creating admin accounts.
